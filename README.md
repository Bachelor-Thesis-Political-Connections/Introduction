# Introduction

Welcome to the Bachelor Thesis theme "Political Connections" for the EUR BA BSc track. 
Political connections and behavior of politicians with respect to firms has been a topic of interest in the general management, finance, and economics literature for a long time. 
In this trajectory, I hope you will come to see why, and what are the most important aspects of this literature specifically, but also finance literature in general. 

In short, this theme will allow you to:

- Get to know the main literature about political connections.
- Understand the main theories about political connections and political interference with business and markets.
- Understand the difference between empirical and theoretical questions, and identify the main methods used in empirical research.
- Formulate your own ideas about political connections
- Get an impression of the variation of mechanisms around the work to regulate politicians' behavior. 

Secondarily, the goal is to introduce students to the main aspects of doing data analysis and statistics. To this end, we will do the following:

- Collect data from various sources
- Identify issues and problems 
- Solving these problems! 
- Doing statistical analysis independently using one of several programming languages. 

**(if you want me to help you):** I am proficient (to some extent) in Python, R and Stata, so you can use any of those languages to work with!

This page contains all relevant course materials with respect to:

- Lecture slides of the introductory lecture
- Data collection
- Articles
- Programming

# A short planning

We will adhere to the course manual, but apply minor exceptions: given that our topic is data-intensive, we spend **more** time on data collection and treatment. 
A rough indication of what is expected from you around what meeting is given below:

| Meeting | Desired research progress | 
| ----- | --------|
| Meeting 1 | Identify a research question and subquestions |
| Meeting 2 | Identify the most important studies, and **find data sources** |
| Meeting 3 | Find the most important data sources you need and extract data |
| Meeting 4 | Try to tidy and reshape the data, try out statistical analyses |
| **Deadline** | **Up until this point, it is allowed to ask me for _help_ with data cleaning** |
| Meeting 5 | Think deeper about your research design, gather additional data |
| Meeting 6 | Perform all statistical analyses, restructure thesis |
| Meeting 7 | Final feedback moment, robustness checks and figures |

As stressed in the table, you have until week 4 to ask for my help with data cleaning. This has two reasons: 

- First, to get you thinking about data requirements early in the process
- Second, to reward groups that work hard and have a good idea about their data early on. 
- Third, 

Afterwards, small questions about data issues during feedback sessions are (of course!) allowed. 

# How to ask for help with coding?

Read up on what [reproducible examples](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) are! In short, reproducible examples allow people you're asking for help to get a quick grasp of the problem, without overflowing them with unnecessary details.
It is probably most important that you:

1. Indicate the language you are working wth
2. Describe the essence of the issue, which requires abstracting from the specific data set you are working with. 
3. Send all the necessary information (errors, data, etc.) I need to reproduce the problem. 

# Examples of clear questions

- How do I merge two datasets in R based on the unique columns of 1 dataset?
- Python's pivot method gives a strange error I don't understand on my dataset and can't find the solution of on Google [and include the error term]
- Do you know how to change the number of stars to indicate significance with Stata?
- Can you help me filter out a particular text from this column in R?
- Can you help me extract data from tables on a particular website?

# Finally..

Make sure to do everything on time! That way, you have ample opportunity to incorporate my feedback to improve your grade in the last weeks! :)
